five simulation modes

1 - quasistatic, pistons move slowly (compared to speed of sound)
    left piston moves in, compressing gas, then right piston moves out, expansion.
    gas stays near equilibrium throughout.
    kinetic energy (temperature) nearly the same after as before, nearly no dissipation (maybe 1%).

2 - left piston moves in quickly, gas is out of equilibrium.  right piston is moved out slowly.
    more kinetic energy added to gas (piston does more work), cannot be extracted by right piston.
    large dissipation.

3 - left piston moves in quickly, right piston moves out quickly after a long delay.
    (time enough for gas to return to equilibrium)
    even larger dissipation than case 2 (more than double).

4 - left piston moves in quickly, right piston moves out quickly,
    delay equal to time of compression wave to travel across chamber.
    wave is "caught" by right piston, energy extracted.
    dissipation less than half of case 3, less even than case 2 (slow moving right piston).

5 - left piston moves in quickly, right piston moves out quickly,
    delay too short, wave cannot be "caught" by right piston.
    dissipation again high, similar to case 3.

how to run -

'f' goes to full screen.
number keys set mode.
hitting space bar sets off simulation.
'n' will reset current mode, or hit number again to reset pistons.
'esc' to exit program.

display -
KE  - current kinetic energy
KE0 - initial kinetic energy
KE1 - energy after compression by left piston
KE2 - energy after expansion by moving right piston

mechanical energy dissipated due to heating of the gas is KE2 - KE0
