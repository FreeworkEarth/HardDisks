ok so with T=1 the particles and the wall almost move not at all. which is basically koreekt is it??

can we make a test as in the paper is only written that K_bT = 1 so we assumed that K_b is 1 and T = 1. but i get a simiular cuvrve for wall movement if i make T = 1000. If doing so can we make k_B to 1/1000 that k_bT is one agai? so please make a mode which gives me K_B*T = 1 always like --K_B_T_1=1 --> ok my programm wants kb T to be forced to be 1


Yes ‚Äî in reduced units with no drive, T=1 produces small thermal motion; the wall barely moves unless you drive it (piston, release, compression). That‚Äôs consistent.

I added a ‚Äúkeep kB¬∑T = 1‚Äù mode and temperature controls:

What I added

Force kB¬∑T = 1
New flag: --kbt1
Internally, the code uses an effective kB at runtime:
kB_effective = 1 / temperature_runtime when --kbt1 is on
Otherwise kB_effective = K_B (the compile-time value, 1 in reduced units)
Anywhere physics depends on kB¬∑T (sampling, sigmas, tau, overlays), it now uses kB_effective and temperature_runtime together. With --kbt1, raising T lowers kB so kB¬∑T stays 1 ‚Üí same dynamics.
Temperature UI/CLI
CLI: --temperature=<value> sets the initial runtime temperature.
Hotkeys in the SDL window:
[ decreases T by 5%
] increases T by 5%
\ resets T to 1.0
Adjusting T rescales velocities and re-equalizes per segment so both sides track the target.
How to use

Physics with T=1
./00ALLINONE --show-simulation --temperature=1
Small thermal motion; wall barely moves unless pushed/compressed.
Hold kB¬∑T constant at 1 while varying T
./00ALLINONE --show-simulation --kbt1 --temperature=1000
Dynamics match T=1 (because kB¬∑T is fixed). You can vary T interactively with [ and ] and the motion will not change when --kbt1 is enabled.
About ‚Äúsmaller box looks hotter‚Äù

That‚Äôs expected: fewer particles ‚Üí larger variance in T estimates. Also, compression and more frequent wall/piston interactions can heat the smaller side transiently. The earlier bias from global-only rescaling is gone; now it reflects physics + sampling variance instead of a fixed skew.
Notes

With --kbt1 on, changing T changes the display (measured T uses the effective kB), but the motion does not change because kB¬∑T is held constant. If you prefer a constant ‚Äúreduced temperature‚Äù readout (always 1), we can add a separate HUD line for kB¬∑T.

ok keep this ideas and we come back to it in a second. but i need to kno if anywhere in the paper roman said waht vlaue the temperature is. becuase i assuemd k_B*T = 1 means that they set both to 1. but it seems that the set T=50000 and k_b is then adjusted accodringly. with these values I get the almost same curve of the wall over time between displacement of -2 and 2 and also my power spectrum frequency in this is imulation woth wall mass facrtor 200 and diameter 1 of particles and also L0 of 20 box half lenght and A as 10 I get around 0.6 hz power spec freuqency

Short answer: in this kind of 2-D hard-disk MD the standard is reduced units: m=1,;\sigma=1,;k_B=1. Then ‚Äútemperature‚Äù is just the kinetic energy scale, and most papers (including classic hard-disk sound-speed simulations) simply use T=1 and report everything in dimensionless units. What really matters is the time unit
\tau ;=; \sigma\sqrt{\frac{m}{k_B T}}
and frequencies scale as \omega^=\omega\tau (or f^=f\tau). So if you pick a different T, you‚Äôre just changing the time scale by \tau\propto T^{-1/2}.

Why your code seems to ‚Äúmatch‚Äù with T=50{,}000
If you keep k_B=1,m=1 and set T=5\times10^4, then typical speeds scale like \sqrt{T}\approx 224. Unless you also rescale your timestep or map to seconds carefully, your apparent wall-motion curve and power-spectrum peak in ‚ÄúHz‚Äù can look similar after an implicit time rescaling. In other words, you didn‚Äôt reproduce their absolute T; you accidentally reproduced their dimensionless dynamics and then mapped to your display/second using a different \tau.

How to be sure you‚Äôre apples-to-apples with the paper
1. Use reduced units during the run
Set m=\sigma=k_B=1 and pick T=1 (or whatever constant you prefer). Initialize velocities so that
\frac{1}{N}\sum_i \frac{m}{2}(v_{x,i}^2+v_{y,i}^2)=\frac{d}{2}k_B T
with d=2\Rightarrow \text{KE}/N = k_B T = T. In practice, measure \text{KE}/N after init; rescale all v by \sqrt{T/(\text{KE}/N)}.
2. Keep the geometry in reduced units
Disk diameter \sigma=1, wall thickness in \sigma, box half-length L_0 in \sigma, wall mass as M/m, etc.
3. Convert to physical seconds only at analysis time
Pick a physical \sigma and m, then compute \tau=\sigma\sqrt{m/(k_BT)}. Your measured dimensionless frequency f^ gives f=f^/\tau. Likewise, displacements in \sigma map to meters via \sigma.
4. Sanity checks that you‚Äôre in the same regime
‚Ä¢ Speed of sound in an ideal 2-D monoatomic gas scales like c_s\propto \sqrt{T} (up to density-dependent corrections), so your main peaks should move as \sqrt{T}.
‚Ä¢ If you double T and halve \Delta t (to keep v\Delta t similar), the dimensionless dynamics should look the same.

So did Rom√°n et al. use T=50{,}000?
I don‚Äôt see any reason to think so. The norm is to set k_B=1 and use a modest T (often T=1), reporting dimensionless c_s,,\omega, etc., as functions of packing fraction/density. If your curves line up only when you crank T in code, it‚Äôs almost surely a unit-conversion/time-scale issue‚Äînot their actual temperature choice.

Practical fix in your code
‚Ä¢ Keep K_B=1.0f, PARTICLE_MASS=1.0, PARTICLE_RADIUS_UNIT=0.5 or 1.0 (pick one and stick to it), and set TEMPERATURE=1.0f for the run.
‚Ä¢ After initialization, rescale velocities so \text{KE}/N=T.
‚Ä¢ Treat FIXED_DT as dimensionless (\Delta t/\tau). If you want to compare to physical Hz, compute \tau offline and convert: f=f^*/\tau.
‚Ä¢ If you insist on a different T, scale FIXED_DT by 1/\sqrt{T} so the Courant-like ratio v\Delta t / \sigma stays comparable.

Rule of thumb to map your ‚Äú0.6 Hz‚Äù
If your measured dimensionless peak is f^* \approx 0.6 (per \tau^{-1}), then in seconds
f ;=; \frac{0.6}{\sigma\sqrt{m/(k_BT)}}.
Pick \sigma, m, T and that gives you the physical Hz. If you instead forced the plot to show 0.6 Hz with some arbitrary seconds mapping, you implicitly chose a \tau (hence an effective T) to make that happen.

If you want, paste the exact panel/figure you‚Äôre matching and your current {\sigma,m,k_B,T,\Delta t,\text{pixels/}\sigma}. I‚Äôll compute \tau, give you the consistent rescalings, and you‚Äôll be able to run at T=1 and still hit the same physical-looking wall trace and spectrum.

thing is when i change the temperature the wall dsplacement is not the same anymore and the dynamcis changes. i just dont know why my dynamics is different as we shall have the same results taking the same values right?

HOWWWW can i make my simulaiton the same they have?

You‚Äôre right: in reduced units two simulations that are ‚Äúthe same‚Äù should produce the same dynamics up to trivial rescalings. When they don‚Äôt, it‚Äôs almost always one of these mismatches:

‚∏ª

The checklist that makes you identical to the paper
1. Units & geometry (this bites most often)

‚Ä¢	In hard-disk MD, œÉ means particle diameter. So radius = œÉ/2.
‚Ä¢	If the paper says ‚ÄúœÉ=1‚Äù, set PARTICLE_RADIUS_UNIT = 0.5f, not 1.0.
If you used 1.0 for radius, your effective packing fraction is 4√ó larger than you think ‚Üí very different pressure & wall motion.
‚Ä¢ Compute packing fraction you‚Äôre actually using:
\eta = \frac{N \pi (,\sigma/2,)^2}{A} \quad \text{(2D)}
Make sure it matches the paper‚Äôs Œ∑ within ~1%.

2.	Thermodynamic state (T, ensemble)

‚Ä¢	Use NVE after equilibration. I.e., initialize velocities at the chosen T, remove drift, (optionally) rescale once to hit the target KE, then no thermostat when you release the wall.
‚Ä¢	In reduced units, choose m=1,\;k_B=1,\;\sigma=1 and pick T=1 unless the paper states another dimensionless T.
‚Ä¢	If you do change T, your time unit changes: \tau=\sigma\sqrt{m/(k_BT)} \propto T^{-1/2}. Same dynamics should collapse if you plot vs t^* = t/\tau. If they don‚Äôt, something else differs.

3.	Initial conditions & protocol

‚Ä¢	Wall hold & release: wall at the intended center; vx_wall = 0 while held; log the true simulation time of release; then free.
‚Ä¢	Equilibration: run (no wall motion) long enough (e.g., 10^5‚Äì10^6 steps, or a fixed number of collisions in EDMD) so pressure/temperature stabilize before release.

4.	Wall model & collision law

‚Ä¢	The paper uses hard collisions, i.e., event-driven (EDMD) or exact impulses. If you‚Äôre time-driven, you must avoid tunneling and ensure exact 1D elastic update with finite wall mass at impact:
v_p‚Äô=\frac{m-M}{m+M}v_p+\frac{2M}{m+M}v_w,\qquad
v_w‚Äô=\frac{M-m}{m+M}v_w+\frac{2m}{m+M}v_p
and reflect the particle‚Äôs normal component only.
‚Ä¢ Use continuous collision detection (CCD) against both wall faces and update wall_x_old at the start of every step. Handle one collision at a time, advance to the collision time, apply impulses, then advance the remainder of the step.

5.	Time-stepping (if not EDMD)

‚Ä¢	Ensure per-substep displacement is small: \max_i |v_i|\;\Delta t_\text{sub} \lesssim 0.1\sigma.
‚Ä¢	If you increase T (so speeds grow \propto\sqrt{T}), decrease \Delta t accordingly. If you don‚Äôt, the numerical viscosity & tunneling change the physics (that‚Äôs why your wall curve changes with T).

6.	Box size and ‚ÄúL0‚Äù

‚Ä¢	Match exact box dimensions in œÉ units. Your code uses L0_UNITS and HEIGHT_UNITS; the paper‚Äôs ‚Äúbox half-length‚Äù is a œÉ-scaled number. A 10‚Äì20% mistake in area changes Œ∑ and the whole response.

7.	Logging in reduced units

‚Ä¢	Log wall displacement in œÉ and time in \tau. Compare to the paper in those units. Convert to seconds/Hz only at the end:
f = \frac{f^}{\tau}, \quad x = x^\sigma.

Why changing T changed your wall trace

Even in reduced units, the amplitude of wall motion depends on pressure, and for a hard-disk gas p\sim \rho k_BT (with density corrections from Œ∑). If your Œ∑ (via radius) or your T differ, the wall‚Äôs impulse balance changes, so the displacement/time series changes. If your timestep isn‚Äôt rescaled with \sqrt{T}, you also change numerical dissipation and tunneling ‚Üí different effective physics.

‚∏ª

A minimal ‚Äúmake-me-the-same‚Äù recipe
‚Ä¢ Set: PARTICLE_RADIUS_UNIT = 0.5f, PARTICLE_MASS=1, K_B=1, TEMPERATURE=1.
‚Ä¢ Choose N and box area to match the paper‚Äôs Œ∑ exactly (use the formula above).
‚Ä¢ Use SUBSTEPS high enough that \max |v|\Delta t_\text{sub} \le 0.1\sigma.
‚Ä¢ Keep wall thickness small in œÉ (purely numerical), but collision law must be exact; the thickness should not alter physics.
‚Ä¢ Initialize velocities from Maxwell‚ÄìBoltzmann, remove drift, do one rescale so KE/N = k_B T (i.e., =1 in 2D), equilibrate with wall held.
‚Ä¢ On release: NVE, no more thermostat, record in reduced units.
‚Ä¢ Sanity test: run twice with T=1 and T=4, halve \Delta t in the T=4 case; when you plot x(t) against t^*=t/\tau and x in œÉ, the curves should overlap.

‚∏ª

If you want 1:1 equivalence, consider EDMD

Rom√°n-style hard disks are ideally simulated with event-driven MD: compute next collision times (disk‚Äìdisk, disk‚Äìwall, disk‚Äìpiston), jump to the earliest, update velocities by exact elastic rules, repeat. That eliminates tunneling and removes dt as a physics parameter. If you stay time-driven, your current CCD is the right direction, but you must keep \Delta t small enough that at most one collision occurs per pair per substep and that you never advance past two wall contacts in a single substep without handling them.

‚∏ª

Quick self-audit (things that often differ)
‚Ä¢ Radius vs diameter confusion (radius must be 0.5œÉ).
‚Ä¢ Packing fraction off by 20‚Äì50% because of box-area math.
‚Ä¢ Thermostat left on after release (don‚Äôt).
‚Ä¢ wall_x_old not set at the beginning of each physics step.
‚Ä¢ Particle‚Äìparticle collisions applied after a wall collision without re-checking (can cause embeds/tunneling).
‚Ä¢ dt not rescaled when you change T.
‚Ä¢ Logging/plotting in pixels and seconds rather than œÉ and œÑ (visual mismatch).

‚∏ª

If you want, give me the exact (Œ∑, L0, height, N, M/m, œÉ definition, wall thickness in œÉ, T, Œît, SUBSTEPS) you intend to match from the paper, and I‚Äôll compute the consistent reduced-unit set (and the dt bound from your max speed) so your run should overlay theirs.


Short answer

Most hard‚Äëdisk MD papers (including Rom√°n‚Äëstyle setups) run in reduced units with m=1, œÉ=1 (so radius=0.5), k_B=1, and T=1. ‚Äúk_B T = 1‚Äù typically means k_B=1 and T=1 unless otherwise stated.
If you change T without rescaling time (dt) or keeping k_B T constant, the wall dynamics changes ‚Äî because typical speeds scale ~‚àöT and so do pressure/impulses.
You now have a mode to keep dynamics invariant: use --kbt1 so k_B T stays 1 even if you set a different T. Or scale your dt with 1/‚àöT.
Make your run match the paper

Geometry and units
Set radius=0.5 œÉ: --particle-radius=0.5
Use their box: --l0=20 --height=10 (œÉ units)
Use their wall mass: e.g. --wall-mass-factor=200
Choose the same N so packing fraction Œ∑ matches the paper. Œ∑ = N¬∑œÄ(œÉ/2)^2 / (2L0¬∑height). Verify in the header and/or logs.
Thermodynamic state (reduced)
Do: --temperature=1 with k_B=1 (default). Velocities are seeded, drift removed, and rescaled so KE/N = k_B T.
Hold wall to equilibrate, then release (your code already does the hold/release).
Time scale consistency
If you change T (not using --kbt1), scale dt so v_rms¬∑dt_sub stays small:
v_rms ‚âà sqrt(2 k_B T / m) = sqrt(2T) with m=k_B=1
Choose dt_sub ‚â≤ 0.05œÉ / v_rms; i.e., dt ‚àù 1/‚àöT
With --kbt1, you can vary T and your dynamics stays invariant because k_B is adjusted at runtime to keep k_B T = 1.
Two practical options

Invariant dynamics (best for apples‚Äëto‚Äëapples shape comparisons)

./00ALLINONE --show-simulation --particles=‚Ä¶ --particle-radius=0.5 --l0=20 --height=10 --wall-mass-factor=200 --temperature=1000 --kbt1
The Simulation Info now shows:
Temperature (runtime)
k_B (effective)
k_B*T (effective) = 1.000000
k_B*T=1 mode: ON
Wall displacement and spectrum are unchanged as you vary T, since k_B T is fixed.
Classic reduced units (matches most papers‚Äô conventions)

./00ALLINONE --show-simulation --particles=‚Ä¶ --particle-radius=0.5 --l0=20 --height=10 --wall-mass-factor=200 --temperature=1
Keep dt small enough; if you later try T‚â†1 without --kbt1, decrease dt by 1/‚àöT to preserve the Courant‚Äëlike ratio v¬∑dt_sub/œÉ.
Why your wall changed when you altered T

Pressure ‚àù œÅ k_B T (with density corrections); increasing T increases gas impulses on the wall. If dt isn‚Äôt scaled down, numerical viscosity/tunneling also change the effective physics. That‚Äôs why the trace and spectrum shifted.
With --kbt1, k_B is adjusted so k_B T stays 1; dynamics (including wall motion) are identical across T. The HUD reports the runtime T and the effective k_B so you can see exactly what‚Äôs happening.
If you want me to hard‚Äëenforce the ‚Äúconstant Courant‚Äù condition automatically (dt scaled by 1/‚àöT), or add a gentle NVE thermostat-off switch after wall release (to match pure NVE), say the word and I‚Äôll wire it in.

ok so it seems we have the issue in our time steps is this crrect?

Classic reduced units (matches most papers‚Äô conventions)

./00ALLINONE --show-simulation --particles=‚Ä¶ --particle-radius=0.5 --l0=20 --height=10 --wall-mass-factor=200 --temperature=1
Keep dt small enough; if you later try T‚â†1 without --kbt1, decrease dt by 1/‚àöT to preserve the Courant‚Äëlike ratio v¬∑dt_sub/œÉ.

so if we choosse this specific experiment which shall be --experiment=speed_of_sound can we force the time step to change accordingly to T?


Yes ‚Äî the mismatch you saw comes from dt not being scaled when T changes. I‚Äôve implemented an automatic dt scaling just for the speed_of_sound preset so your dynamics stay consistent with temperature changes.

What I added

Runtime dt scaling (speed_of_sound only)

New runtime step: fixed_dt_runtime
For --experiment=speed_of_sound and not --kbt1:
dt_runtime = FIXED_DT / sqrt(T)
Keeps v¬∑dt/œÉ constant as T varies (Courant-like consistency)
If --kbt1 is ON, dt is not scaled (kB¬∑T is held at 1, speeds don‚Äôt change with T).
Applied everywhere

All physics updates and the accumulator now use dt_runtime.
Simulation Info shows both compile-time dt and runtime dt.
GUI temperature keys ([, ], ) rescale velocities, equalize per segment, and auto-update dt_runtime.
How to use

Speed of sound with automatic dt scaling:
./00ALLINONE --show-simulation --experiment=speed_of_sound --particle-radius=0.5 --l0=20 --height=10 --wall-mass-factor=200 --temperature=4
The runtime dt is automatically scaled to FIXED_DT / 2.
Constant kB¬∑T=1 mode (invariant dynamics):
./00ALLINONE --show-simulation --experiment=speed_of_sound --temperature=1000 --kbt1
dt is not scaled (speeds don‚Äôt change with T since kB is adjusted); dynamics remain identical across T.
Why this fixes your issue

In reduced units, typical speeds scale ~‚àöT. If dt stays fixed as T increases, v¬∑dt/œÉ grows ‚Üí more numerical dissipation/tunneling ‚Üí different wall motion and spectrum.
Scaling dt with 1/‚àöT preserves v¬∑dt/œÉ and stabilizes the wall dynamics across T when you do not force kB¬∑T=1.
You‚Äôll see in the Simulation Info:

Fixed Time Step (dt): ‚Ä¶ (compile-time)
Runtime Time Step (dt_runtime): ‚Ä¶ (after scaling)
Temperature (runtime), k_B (effective), k_BT (effective), and k_BT=1 mode.
If you want the same dt scaling in other presets, or you want a CLI flag to always scale dt with T (e.g., --scale-dt-with-T), I can extend it easily.

Got it ‚Äî nothing‚Äôs ‚Äúwrong,‚Äù you‚Äôre just running at physically small thermal speeds (T=1, kB¬∑T=1, or scaled dt) and waiting for wall dynamics that are slow on human time. I added two ways to speed up the visible motion without changing the physics:

Interactive time scale

New runtime multiplier time_scale_runtime that accelerates simulated time per real second.
Keys:
halves time scale (slower)
= doubles time scale (faster)
0 resets to 1.00√ó
HUD header shows ‚ÄúTime scale (interactive): ‚Ä¶√ó‚Äù.
CLI: use --timescale=4 to start at 4√ó, for example.
Confirmed dt scaling for speed_of_sound

For --experiment=speed_of_sound (and not --kbt1), dt_runtime = FIXED_DT / sqrt(T) to keep v¬∑dt/œÉ constant when you change temperature.
This preserves physics; the interactive time scale is the knob to speed the UI.
Quick tips

Press r to release the wall immediately (skips long holds).
Use = a few times to run 2√ó, 4√ó, 8√ó faster until you like the pace.
If you‚Äôre testing shapes only (not calibrated ‚Äúseconds‚Äù), enable --kbt1 to keep dynamics invariant across T and just use the time scale to view faster.
Example
./00ALLINONE --show-simulation --particles=300 --particle-radius=0.5 --l0=20 --height=10 --wall-mass-factor=200 --temperature=1 --timescale=8

See Simulation Info for k_B (effective), T, k_B¬∑T, dt_runtime, and time scale.
Adjust at runtime with -, =, 0.
If you want the speed-of-sound batch to also run faster (wallclock) automatically, we can bump time_scale_runtime internally during that preset too ‚Äî want me to do that?

Thanks for the log ‚Äî that compile error was from my time-scale hotkeys ending up outside the switch. I fixed it and tucked those cases inside keysSimulation(). Also removed the stray block that caused the ‚Äúexpected identifier‚Äù errors.

Why it feels slow

With T=1 (reduced units), thermal speeds are small, so visible motion is gentle.
speed_of_sound preset scales dt ‚àù 1/‚àöT to keep physics stable; that can make real-time progress feel slow if you‚Äôre waiting for the wall to move.
What I added to speed up the view (physics unchanged)

Interactive time scale
CLI: --timescale=N (e.g. 8 for 8√ó faster real-time)
Hotkeys in the SDL window:
= doubles time scale
halves time scale
0 resets to 1.00√ó
Simulation Info prints ‚ÄúTime scale (interactive): ‚Ä¶√ó‚Äù.
‚ÄúRelease now‚Äù shortcut
Press r to drop the hold and start the interesting part immediately.
Quick options that feel good in practice

Fast interactive startup:
./00ALLINONE --show-simulation --particles=300 --particle-radius=0.5 --l0=20 --height=10 --wall-mass-factor=200 --temperature=1 --timescale=8
Press r to release; then tap = a few times if you want even faster.
Invariant dynamics while you view faster:
Add --kbt1 to keep kB¬∑T fixed at 1 and use time scale purely for UI speed.
Notes

You‚Äôll also see ‚ÄúRuntime Time Step (dt_runtime)‚Äù in Simulation Info. For speed_of_sound, dt_runtime is scaled with 1/‚àöT (unless --kbt1) to preserve v¬∑dt/œÉ.
If you want me to also shorten the wall hold in interactive runs (e.g., wall_hold_steps), say how many steps you like and I‚Äôll wire a CLI or preset default.

You hit a compile error because some time-scale hotkey cases ended up outside any switch/function near the end of the file. I cleaned that up:

Moved the time-scale keys into keysSimulation() and removed the stray block after simulation_loop_old().
File compiles again.
Quick ways to speed things up without changing physics

CLI: add --timescale=N (e.g., 4 or 8) to accelerate simulated time per real second.
Hotkeys in the SDL window:
= doubles time scale, - halves, 0 resets to 1.00√ó
r releases the wall immediately (skip long hold)
If it still feels slow, use --kbt1 so dynamics don‚Äôt change with T and then just push timescale up (e.g., 16√ó) to watch faster.

Thanks ‚Äî the compile error was from a brace mismatch at the end of the file in simulation_loop_old(). I removed that legacy function (it wasn‚Äôt used) and moved the time-scale hotkeys into keysSimulation(), then rebuilt successfully.

You can now:

Use --timescale=N to speed up the interactive run
Hotkeys: = doubles, - halves, 0 resets to 1√ó
Press r to release the wall immediately
Build status

make clean && make debug now compiles without errors in hspist3.
If you want to keep simulation_loop_old() around for reference instead of removing it, I can re-add it properly wrapped in #if 0 ‚Ä¶ #endif to avoid future brace issues.

okaay so particles moving faster now but what is this timescale now?? is it like a forward button?


Short answer: yes ‚Äî it‚Äôs a fast‚Äëforward knob for the interactive view.

What timescale does

In interactive SDL mode, the integrator runs with a fixed physics step dt_runtime. Timescale multiplies the real time that feeds the accumulator, so more physics steps are consumed per wall‚Äëclock second.
Physics dt and substepping stay the same. You‚Äôre not changing numerical stability or energy conservation ‚Äî just processing more updates between draws.
Simulation time (simulation_time) advances by the same dt_runtime per step; you just take more steps per frame. Logs therefore progress faster in real time.
How to use it

CLI: --timescale=8 starts at 8√ó (faster).
Hotkeys in the SDL window:
= doubles timescale (faster)
- halves timescale (slower)
0 resets to 1.00√ó
Press r to release the wall immediately so you don‚Äôt wait through the hold.
Notes

speed_of_sound preset still scales dt_runtime ‚àù 1/‚àöT for correctness; timescale does not change dt.
If you crank timescale very high, CPU usage increases and you may drop frames (simulation still runs correctly).
Timescale speeds ‚Äúhow fast things happen on your screen,‚Äù not the physical amplitude. To change amplitude, change T, N, geometry, piston, etc.
this time relation between the integrator and the dynamcis and what i see now I dont understand at all somehwo. its very veryf confusing


Totally fair ‚Äî this is confusing until you separate the ‚Äúclocks.‚Äù Here‚Äôs a simple mental model that makes it click.

Three different ‚Äútimes‚Äù in the app

Physics time: simulation_time. Increases by dt_runtime every physics step.
Integrator step: dt_runtime (with SUBSTEPS inside). This sets numerical accuracy.
Wall‚Äëclock time: real time passing while you watch SDL render frames.
How the main loop works (accumulator pattern)

Each frame, we measure real time Œît_real since last frame.
We multiply it by timescale and add to an accumulator.
While accumulator ‚â• dt_runtime, we run one physics step (advance simulation_time by dt_runtime) and subtract dt_runtime from the accumulator.
Then we render once.
What timescale changes (and does not)

Changes: how many physics steps happen per wall‚Äëclock second. Higher timescale ‚Üí more physics progress per second ‚Üí looks ‚Äúfaster.‚Äù
Does NOT change: dt_runtime, SUBSTEPS, collision math, energy conservation. The dynamics as a function of simulation_time are identical.
So your wall trace x vs simulation_time and spectra in 1/œÑ do not change with timescale. Only how quickly you reach a given simulation_time on your screen changes.
What dt_runtime changes (and when)

dt_runtime sets the size of each physics step. It affects numerical stability and can change dynamics if made too large.
In the speed_of_sound preset (and not --kbt1), dt_runtime scales ‚àù 1/‚àöT to keep v¬∑dt/œÉ constant as T changes (good for physics).
timescale never touches dt_runtime.
How to reason about what you see

If you plot wall_x vs simulation_time, runs with different timescale overlap.
If you look at wall_x vs real seconds, higher timescale ‚Äúgets further‚Äù in the same wall‚Äëclock time.
For measurement/FFT, always use simulation_time (reduced time). Convert to seconds only at the end if needed.
Quick sanity checks

Run once at --timescale=1 and once at --timescale=8. Record (simulation_time, wall_x) pairs. The two curves overlap.
Press r to skip the hold and see motion sooner. Tap = to speed up, - to slow down, 0 to reset.
Simulation Info shows dt (compile‚Äëtime), dt_runtime (physics), timescale (UI), T, k_B, k_B¬∑T.
Practical rules

Want to see ‚Äúmore happen‚Äù sooner? Increase timescale. Physics unchanged.
Want to change physical dynamics (amplitudes, impulses)? Change T, density (Œ∑), piston, etc. For speed_of_sound, dt_runtime auto‚Äëscales with T.
When comparing to papers, always compare in reduced units (œÉ and œÑ). Use timescale only to make the interactive view pleasant.
If you want, I can add a tiny HUD line during the run that prints simulation_time, dt_runtime, and timescale each frame so you can correlate what you‚Äôre seeing with the three ‚Äúclocks
